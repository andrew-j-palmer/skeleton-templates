# skeleton-templates
Collection of Website Templates that utilize the Skeleton Framework by Dave Gamache. Written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with minimal use of other libraries. While I originally had it in my head that these templates were going to use ONLY HTML, CSS, and JS, I decided that's not really necessary or realistic, so I'm just going to go crazy and use whatever I want, with proper citation and links to what was used per template.
